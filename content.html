                presence deeper into space and expand our knowledge of
                the universe, the Agency’s efforts also reach into
                another territory—the inner space of the human body.
                NASA partnerships are exploring the use of carbon
                nanotubes to diagnose and treat brain tumors, perfecting
                fiber optic probes for detecting cataracts that cloud
                vision, and developing software for recognizing and
                managing depression. From experiments on the
                International Space Station to aeronautics research,
                NASA programs are also resulting in spinoffs that
                improve fitness, treat disease, and save lives. These
                resulting medical technologies are among the more than
                1,600 NASA spinoffs recorded since 1976.</div>

            <p>Efforts to improve water conservation and filtration
                for space travel led to the development of nanofiber
                filters capable of removing more than 99.99 percent of
                dangerous particles from water. The filters now purify
                drinking water on Earth and allow factories to clean and
                recycle water for industrial use.</p>

            <p>2,000,000,000 is the approximate number of gallons of
                fuel saved by winglets, the upturned tips on the wings
                of many commercial aircraft, as of 2010. This
                drag-reducing technology was proven through studies by
                Langley Research Center’s Richard Whitcomb and by tests
                conducted at Dryden Flight Research Center. The benefits
                abound—not only do the winglets save fuel, they
                represent a reduction of more than $4 billion in costs
                and almost 21.5 million tons in carbon dioxide
                emissions.</p>

                        presence deeper into space and expand our

                        also reach into another territory—the inner
                        space of the human body. NASA partnerships are
                        exploring the use of carbon nanotubes to

                        cloud vision, and developing software for

                    and Marshall Space Flight Center to develop
                    something called Petroleum Remediation Product
                    (PRP). Years later, Universal Remediation Inc.
                    expanded the uses of the microencapsulation
                    technology to clean up water with spills of fuel,
                    motor oil, or petroleum hydrocarbons. Basically,

                    with hollow centers—absorb contaminants and leave
                    the water behind. Today, PRP is packaged and sold in

                <p>Starting in the 1970s, NASA conducted tests to
                    refine the shape of trucks to reduce aerodynamic
                    drag and improved efficiency. This core research led
                    to a change in the design of the modern semi truck,
                    a softening of the leading edge that greatly
                    improves fuel efficiency.</p>

                <p>The winglet is an upturned wingtip, a lifting
                    surface designed to operate in the wingtip “vortex,”
                    a whirlpool of air at an airplane’s wingtips. It
                    takes advantage of the turbulent vortex flow by
                    producing forward thrust. This reduces drag and

                <p>Throughout the course of its over 50-year
                    history, in order to fulfill its mission needs, NASA
                    has created many unique and innovative technologies.
                    Oftentimes these innovations find uses outside of
                    their original aerospace applications, surprising us
                    by ending up in everyday items, enriching our daily
                    lives. While not all of the spinoff technologies
                    enabled by NASA research and development end up in
                    our homes—many meet complex medical and industrial
                    challenges or help to preserve the Earth’s natural
                    resources—sometimes these high tech advances work
                    their ways into the goods and services that we take
                    for granted as consumers. Whether as nutritional
                    supplements in infant formula or air purifiers that
                    prevent over-ripening and spoiling of produce, NASA
                    technology is everywhere we look.</p>

                <h1>Industrial Productivity</h1>
                <p>A s NASA designs new components for its
                    aeronautics and space missions, engineers are
                    developing needed processes and materials to
                    accomplish this cutting-edge work. Oftentimes, these
                    innovations find direct application in the
                    commercial industrial realms, allowing manufacturers
                    to save money and time, improve the quality and
                    lifespan of products, and rework the ways products
                    are designed and assembled. NASA’s innovations have,
                    among other things, led to the development of
                    machines that run hotter and longer, created
                    stronger joints and fittings, and made industrial
                    products lighter and more efficient.</p>

                <p>IsoTruss, a lightweight grid structure developed
                    with support from NASA, is as much as 12 times
                    stronger than steel, inexpensive, and fully
                    recyclable. It can be used for utility poles,
                    reinforcement of concrete structures, prostheses,
                    and sporting goods.</p>

                <h1>High-Temperature Powdered Lubricant Saves
                    Millions of Dollars</h1>
                <p>PS300, a high-temperature, solid lubri- cant
                    coating developed for use in oil-free
                    turbomachinery, is capable of operating at high
                    temperatures with increased reliabil- ity, lowered
                    weight, reduced maintenance, and increased power.
                    PS300 has found wide-spread industrial application
                    and is saving the manufacturing industry millions of
                    dollars.</p>

            <p>NASA and its partners worked to develop a solvent to
                remediate the groundwater at Kennedy Space Center launch
                facilities. The resulting technology uses iron parti-
                cles in an environmentally friendly oil and water base
                to neutralize toxic chemicals. Non-exclusive licenses
                for the technology have been granted to eight companies.

                power to electric motors, elim- inating the mechanical

                <p>NASA has a long history of finding applications
                    of space and aeronautics technologies that provide
                    broad public benefits. The basis for the Agency’s
                    direction to do this can be directly traced to the
                    National Aeronautics and Space Act that created NASA
                    in 1958. Since that initial call to action, NASA’s
                    emphasis on safety has translated not just to its
                    rocket launches and laboratory practices, but also
                    to innovations that improve our everyday lives,
                    protecting the public and making us safer by
                    supporting emergency responders, providing for
                    people in crisis situations, detecting biological
                    and chemical threats, and enhancing national
                    security efforts at home and abroad.</p>

                    designed and patented a hydrody- namically
                    stabilized ballast system that would prevent a life
                    raft from tipping in choppy seas and fierce winds.
                    It has been commercialized and since been credited
                    with saving over 400 lives.</p>

                <p>Throughout the course of its over 50-year
                    history, in order to fulfill its mission needs, NASA
                    has created many unique and innovative technologies.
                    Oftentimes these innovations find uses outside of
                    their original aerospace applications, surprising us
                    by ending up in everyday items, enriching our daily
                    lives. While not all of the spinoff technologies
                    enabled by NASA research and development end up in
                    our homes—many meet complex medical and industrial
                    challenges or help to preserve the Earth’s natural
                    resources—sometimes these high tech advances work
                    their ways into the goods and services that we take
                    for granted as consumers. Whether as nutritional
                    supplements in infant formula or air purifiers that
                    prevent over-ripening and spoiling of produce, NASA

                    commercial industrial realms, allowing manufacturers
                    to save money and time, improve the quality and
                    lifespan of products, and rework the ways products
                    are designed and assembled. NASA’s innovations have,
                    among other things, led to the development of
                    machines that run hotter and longer, created
                    stronger joints and fittings, and made industrial
                    products lighter and more efficient.</p>

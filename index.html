                travel are leading to safer, more efficient, and more
                environmentally friendly transportation on Earth.
                Whether providing for zero-emission automobiles, warning
                airplane passengers of turbulence, or saving millions of
                gallons of fuel, these spinoffs—among the over 1,600

                destroys airborne bacteria, mold, fungi, mycotoxins,
                viruses, volatile organic compounds (like ethylene), and
                odors. What’s more, the devices have no filters that

                has had a profound impact on transportation. Since its
                founding in 1958, NASA’s pioneering research has
                advanced aeronautics and other modes of transportation
                as well. Through partnerships with private industry,
                NASA expertise and technologies developed for space
                travel are leading to safer, more efficient, and more
                environmentally friendly transportation on Earth.
                Whether providing for zero-emission automobiles, warning
                airplane passengers of turbulence, or saving millions of
                gallons of fuel, these spinoffs—among the over 1,600

                space and aeronautics technologies that provide broad
                public benefits. The basis for the Agency’s direction to
                do this can be directly traced to the National
                Aeronautics and Space Act that created NASA in 1958.
                Since that initial call to action, NASA’s emphasis on
                safety has translated not just to its rocket launches
                and laboratory practices, but also to innovations that
                improve our everyday lives, protecting the public and
                making us safer by supporting emergency responders,
                providing for people in crisis situations, detecting

            <p>Experiments with algae as a food source for long
                duration space flight led to the discovery of a nutrient
                now found in over 90 percent of the infant formulas sold
                in the United States, as well as those sold in over 65
                other countries.</p>
